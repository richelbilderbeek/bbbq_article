\caption{Percentage of epitopes derived from a TMH for epitopes taken from the IEDB, for two different types of assays:  an MHC ligand assay, as well as a T cell assay.  The values between brackets show the the number of epitopes that were predicted to overlapping with a TMH per all epitopes that could be uniquely mapped to the representative human reference proteome.}
