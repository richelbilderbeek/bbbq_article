\begin{abstract}

Transmembrane helices (TMHs) in the human proteome
are an overrepresented potential source of epitopes on major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I for the majority of HLA-I haplotypes. 
It is unknown if this same overrepresentation
also holds for the proteome of a pathogen.
Additionally, it is unknown if TMH-II is also likelier to present
TMHs than expected by chance. 
Lastly, if the immune system if more tailored to detect polypeptides
derived from TMHs, can we confirm this by detecting the evolutionary
conservation of this behavior?
This study shows that MHC-I [also has/does not have] more
epitopes derived from a TMH for a pathogen proteome, when compared with
a host proteome.
Additionally, MHC-II binds to polypeptides derived from TMHs 
[less/equally/more] often than expected by chance.
Lastly, this study shows that in the mutation rate in TMHs of a pathogen
is [lower/as much/higher], hinting at 
evolutionary [conservation/neutrality/disruptive selection].
Our findings suggest that the immune system is [less/neutral/more]
vigilant to TMHs than expected by chance and this has left [a/no]
signal in the evolutionary history of the pathogen.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Immune response}

\richel{Check against stupidity}
Our immune system fights invaders on a daily basis.
These invaders can be fungi, bacteria or viruses.
The innate immune response is its first general 
and immediate strategy, where the acquired immune response
needs time to develop its specialized and more effective
combat forces.

\paragraph{Immune response by MHC-I}

\richel{Check against stupidity}
All nucleated cells in humans present randomly sampled polypeptides
fragments to the surroundings of the cell using MHC class I molecules.
If a cell gets infected by a virus, also the virus' polypeptides
will be presented at the cell surface. The viral antigen is detected 
by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which will kill the infected cell.

\paragraph{Immune response by MHC-II}

\richel{Check against stupidity}
Bacteria and fungi do not infect a cell with their foreign DNA,
but are detected by the proteins on their cell walls. MHC class II molecules 
bind to specific polypeptide fragments. This binding allows T and B cells,
which all express MHC-II, to detect a pathogen and trigger the response to
kill the pathogen. Note that the foreign proteins of a viral envelope 
can be detected in this way as well, which is commonly used in vaccination.

\paragraph{Non-random epitopes}

\richel{Check against stupidity}
Any human's immune system detects only a selection of all possible
polypeptide fragments. Each MHC molecule can only express (MHC-I)
or detect (MHC-II) a couple of polypeptides. An increased detection
is obtained by expressing a wide variety of
MHCs, which is assured by the human leukocyte antigen gene complex (HLA).
However, a different HLA will result in a different variety of MHCs,
that will display different polypeptide fragments. Additionally, there
may have been selection the HLA to display and or detect different
polypeptide fragments.

\paragraph{MHC-I}

\richel{Check against stupidity}
For MHC-I, it was found that predicted epitopes derived 
from human transmembrane helices (TMHs)
are over-presented by all HLA-A and 
most HLA-B super types (\cite{bianchi2017}). 
One explanation is that the presentation of TMHs 
may have an evolutionary advantage for 
the (human) host, as TMHs have a reduced variability 
due to the functional requirement of being able to span a lipid 
bilayer. 
Due to this, pathogens have a lower chance to develop an escape mutation,
as many mutations will result in a disfunctional TMH.
Note that the mechanism by which a cell presents its TMHs is
yet unknown.

\paragraph{MHC-II}

\richel{Check against stupidity}
If presentation of TMHs on MHC-I would bring an evolutionary advantage 
in the recognition of pathogens by the immune system, 
it would follow that this is equally important for MHC-II, 
especially as CD4+ T cell help is needed for a long lasting CD8+ T cell 
response \cite{novy2007cd4}. 
The mechanism to detect foreign TMHs by MHC-II would be unknown, 
similar to the discovery that MHC-I presents TMHs.

\paragraph{Evolutionary arms race}

\richel{Check against stupidity}
The human immune system and human pathogen are in an evolutionary
arms race, in which our immune systems is selected for the detection
of pathogens, whereas pathogens are selected to avoid being detected.
If the human immune system is more prone to display (and possibly 
detect) polypeptides derived from TMHs, one may expect to find 
an evolutionary signal in pathogens as well. 

\paragraph{Evolutionary signal of unknown strength for virus}

\richel{Check against stupidity}
Regarding human viruses, we do not know the extent to which the human
immune systems selects on these, nor which loci are selected
upon \richel{so I should read the literature on that}. 
We predict that there is a strong 
evolutionary conservation in regions that are essential for viral proteins'
functions. Because these regions are rare in a viral proteome,
and differ widely between pathogens, we expect that the human immune system
is not tailored to detect these sites. TMHs, however, have less 
functional constraints yet are more general. Because TMHs are more general,
we expect it for the immune system to pay off to be more attentive towards
TMHs. 
Additionally, viruses are not only selected for their evasion of an 
immune response, yet are selected to have a high reproductive value.
Because the strength of the evolutionary signal is unknown,
we use a strong data set to be able to detect it.

\paragraph{Evolutionary signal of unknown strength for bacteria}

\richel{Check against stupidity}
Regarding human pathogenic bacteria, we do not know the extent to which the 
human immune systems selects on these, nor which loci are selected
upon \richel{so I should read the literature on that}.
Because most bacterial pathogens are generalists, that is,
can infect multiple hosts, we expect the selection pressure exerted
by the human immune response to be weak.
Also, it is unknown if bacterial TMHs are detected by MHC-II at all.
Due to this, the strength of the evolutionary signal is unknown,
thus we need a strong data set to be able to detect it.

\paragraph{Data sets}

\richel{Check against stupidity}
To detect an evolutionary signal for selection on the TMHs of viruses, 
we use the many time-dated COVID-19 proteomes.
We can assume that only after the moment that COVID-19 spilled over 
to humans, it has mostly been the human immune system selecting against
its detection, although this is only part of the selection for 
having a high transmission rate.
To detect an evolutionary signal for selection on the TMHs of bacteria, 
we use the proteomes of Mycobacterium. Mycobacterium is \richel{something}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Hypotheses}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathcal{H}_1$: MHC-I has the same percentage of epitopes overlapping
    with TMHs in Homo sapiens as in COVID-19 as in Mycobacterium
  \item $\mathcal{H}_2$: MHC-II has the same percentage of epitopes overlapping
    with TMHs as expected by chance in Homo sapiens and COVID-19 and Mycobacterium
  \item $\mathcal{H}_3$: The TMHs of both COVID-19 and Mycobacterium
    have the same mutation rate 
    as the cytosolic and extracellular parts of their transmembrane proteins
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methods}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{MHC-I}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We used the same analysis as \cite{bianchi2017},
except that instead of a human reference proteome,
we use the proteome of the first sequenced COVID-19 strain (\cite{wu2020new},
GenBank ID of MN908947.3, \url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947})
and a reference Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
proteome (\url{https://www.ebi.ac.uk/reference_proteomes}, UP000001584, 
83332 MYCTU).

Bianchi and colleagues obtained a distribution of 
percentages of MHC-I epitopes overlap with TMHs in Homo sapiens
for the different HLA haplotypes, with an average of 5.3\%.
We obtained a similar distribution of percentages of MHC-I epitopes that 
overlap with TMHs for the different HLA haplotypes, but then applied to
COVID-19 and Mycobacterium.

We compare the distributions of humans and each pathogen
using a two-sample 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The KS test determines if two samples
are derived from the same distribution, without making assumptions
regarding the shape of that distribution. 

We will reject
the null hypothesis that MHC-I has the same percentage of epitopes 
overlapping with TMHs in Homo sapiens compared to each pathogen when 
the KS statistic $D_{n,m}$ follows the relationship as shown in 
equation \ref{eq:ks}, for a significance level $\alpha = 0.05$
and $n = m = 13$ HLA haplotypes.

\begin{equation}
   D_{n,m} > \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \cdot \sqrt{ -\ln(\frac{\alpha}{2}) \cdot \frac{1 + \frac{n}{m}}{2} }
\  \label{eq:ks}
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{MHC-2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For MHC-II, we do the same analysis as MHC-I, except for
MHC-II haplotypes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{MHC-I}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Figure \ref{fig:1} shows the percentages of epitopes overlapping 
with TMHs for a human, COVID-19 and Mycobacterium proteome.
The KS test to determine if these percentages are sampled from
a same distribution resulted in a p-value of \richel{unknown},
which makes us reject/accept the hypothesis that these percentages
are sampled from the same distribution.

\section{Conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We found that the percentages of epitopes overlapping 
with TMHs for a human and COVID-19 proteome are 
[similar/different]. In other words, the
epitopes that MHC-I presents are [as/not as] likely 
to be derived from TMH within either a human host and its viral pathogen.

We found that the percentages of epitopes overlapping 
with TMHs for a human and Mycobacterium proteome are 
[similar/different]. In other words, the
epitopes that MHC-I presents are [as/not as] likely

	% We conclude that MHC-II binds to TMH peptides with a higher/lower/equal
	% probability than expected by chance. 

	% We conclude that the evolutionary conservation if the TMH parts of membrane
	% proteins is higher/less/equal compare to its non-TMH counterparts.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We concluded that the
epitopes that MHC-I presents are [as/not as] likely 
to be derived from TMH within either a human host and its viral pathogen.
Because the full COVID-19 only has 4 TMHs \richel{check}, the percentages
of MHC-I epitopes being part of a TMH are likelier to be affected by
stochasticity. We chose to use COVID-19 regardless, as the thousands
of its time-dated genomic sequences are ideal for determining the 
evolutionary conservation of MHC-I detecting TMHs. 

We concluded that the
epitopes that MHC-I presents are [as/not as] likely 
to be derived from TMH within either a human host and its bacterial pathogen.
Because a bacterium does not infect a cell, thus its polypeptides
will not be presented by MHC-I, this result is [unexpected/expected]
