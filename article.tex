\section{Methods}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are thousands of MHC2 alleles known.
For this research, we picked the three alleles that are most abundant,
accoring to \richel{reference here}, 
which are DRB4*0101, 
HLA-DPA10103-DPB10402 
\richel{
  we decided for DPB1*0402, but there are multiple alleles matching.
  I just picked the first one of the alleles matching, which are:
  HLA-DPA10103-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10104-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10105-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10106-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10107-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10108-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10109-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10110-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10201-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10202-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10203-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10204-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10301-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10302-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10303-DPB10402,
  HLA-DPA10401-DPB10402
}
and DQA1*0501/DQB1*0301,
that are present in respectively 31, 41 and 59 percent 
\richel{fix numbers}
of the current human population.
