\begin{abstract}

Transmembrane helices (TMHs) are an overrepresented source of epitopes on major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I for the majority of HLA-I haplotypes. 
It is unknown why there is such a preference exists and 
whether this is the case for MHC-II haplotypes. 
This study shows that also MHC-II binds to polypeptides derived from TMHs 
more often than expected by chance. It is unknown if a signal of
natural selection is present in the proteome coding for TMHs.
This study shows that in the mutation rate in TMHs of [a pathogen] 
are [less/equal/more], hinting at 
evolutionary [conservation/neutrality/disruptive selection].
Our findings suggest that developing vaccines targeting the TMHs of
pathogens is a [good/neutral/bad] idea.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For MHC-1, it was found that epitopes derived from transmembrane helices (TMHs)
are over-presented by all human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A and 
most HLA-B super types (\cite{bianchi2017}). 
One explanation is that the 
presentation of especially TMHs may have an evolutionary advantage for 
the (human) host. The argumentation for this is that the TMHs are more 
conserved due to the functional requirement of being able to span a lipid 
bilayer. Additionally, there are limited escape mutations possible for the 
pathogen, as many will result in a non-functional TMH.

However, that argumentation can also be countered as there are limited unique 
polypeptide fragments and TMHs are a conserved throughout all species, it is 
likelier that host and pathogen share the same unique epitope sequences, 
resulting in the pathogen avoiding detection due to the negative T-cell 
selection process in the thymus \richel{Frans, jij beweerde dat bacterien
en mensen compleet verschillende TMH sequenties hebben. Als ik dat goed
onthouden hebt, klopt deze paragraaf dus niet}

If presentation of TMHâ€™s on MHC-I would bring an evolutionary advantage 
in the recognition of pathogens by the immune, 
it would follow that this is equally important for MHC-II. 
MHC-II, which is necessary for the activation of B-cells after the detection 
of bacterial pathogens, e.g.  tuberculosis, by dendritic cells or [...]. 
From the earlier research done on MHC-I, it naturally follows to check if 
also MHC-II is more likely to present TMHs than expected by chance. 
Extending the previous study on MHC-I, we also measure the evolutionary 
conservation of TMH epitopes in Mycoplasma pathogens to adress if 
presentation of TMH derived epitopes has an evolutionary advantage.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Hypotheses}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathcal{H}_1$: MHC-I has the same percentage of epitopes overlapping
    with TMHs in Homo sapiens as in COVID-19
  \item $\mathcal{H}_2$: MHC-II has the same percentage of epitopes overlapping
    with TMHs as expected by chance
  \item $\mathcal{H}_3$: The TMHs of COVID-19 have the same mutation rate 
    as the cytosolic and extracellular parts of its transmembrane proteins
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methods}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{MHC-I}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We used the same analysis as \cite{bianchi2017},
except that instead of a human reference proteome,
we used the proteome of the first sequenced COVID-19 strain (\cite{wu2020new}),
with a GenBank ID of MN908947.3, as can be downloaded 
from \url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947}.

Bianchi and colleagues obtained a distribution of 
percentages of MHC-I epitopes overlap with TMHs in Homo sapiens
for the different HLA haplotypes, with has an average of 5.3\%.
We obtained a similar distribution of percentages of MHC-I epitopes that 
overlap with TMHs for the different HLA haplotypes, but then applied to
COVID-19.

We compare these distribution using a two-sample 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The KS test determines if two samples
are derived from a same distribution, without making assumptions
regarding the shape of that distribution. We will reject
the null hypothesis that MHC-I has the same percentage of epitopes 
overlapping with TMHs in Homo sapiens as in COVID-19 when 
the KS statistic follows the relationship as show in 
figure \ref{fig:ks}, for an $\alpha$ of $0.05$.

    Condition of a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic to rejects a null
    hypothesis. $D_{n,m}$ is the KS statistic, $n = m$ is the size
    of the samples, in this case, the number of HLA haplotypes ($n = m = 13$).
    $\alpha = 0.05$ is the significance level.

\subsection{MHC-2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\iffalse
	Transmembrane helices and strong MHC-II-binding peptides
	were predicted for a tuberculosis reference proteome 
	from \url{https://www.ebi.ac.uk/reference_proteomes}
	using the \verb;epitopeome; R package (\cite{epitopeome}).
	We picked the three MHC-II alleles that are most abundant 
	in the current human population, 
	which are DRB4*0101, HLA-DPA10103-DPB10402 
	\richel{
	  We decided for DPB1*0402, but there are multiple alleles matching.
	  I just picked the first one of the alleles matching, which are:
	  HLA-DPA10x-DPB10402, where x equals 103-110, 201-204, 301-303 or 401
	}
	and DQA1*0501/DQB1*0301 \richel{reference here}.
	The 5\% peptides with the lowest IC50 values were defined as binders.
	We then simply counted the number of amino acids that were present inside the
	cell, within the membrane or outside of the cell, as well as if it was part 
	of a strong MHC-II binding site, as shown in figue \ref{tab:results}.


	The \verb;epitopeome; R package (\cite{epitopeome}) binds 
	together the \verb;tmhmm; (\cite{tmhmm}) and \verb;netmhc2pan; 
	(\cite{netmhc2pan}) 
	R packages. \verb;tmhmm; provides an R interface to
	TMHMM (\cite{krogh2001predicting, sonnhammer1998hidden}), a tool
	to predict where membrane proteins' amino acids are located within the
	membrance.   
	\verb;netmhc2pan; provides an R interface to
	NetMHC2pan (\cite{jensen2018improved}), a tool
	to predict MHC-II binding to proteins.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Evolutionary conservation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\iffalse
	The evolutionary conservation of TMHs was measured from a
	DNA alignment of multiple transmembrane proteins in multitiple
	species of the mycoplasma bacterial family
	\richel{how obtained exactly? how alignment done?}.

	Using the \verb;tmhprot; R package (\cite{tmhprot}), the DNA alignment is split
	into two alignments, one for the TMH parts, another for the non-TMH
	parts. Each alignment was tested by the \verb;mcbette; 
	R package (\cite{mcbette}) to select the Bayesian inference model with
	the highest evidence (a.k.a. the marginal likelihood) using the nested
	sampling approach as described in \cite{maturana2018model},
	using the popular Bayesian phylogenetic tool 
	BEAST2 (\cite{bouckaert2014beast}) in the back-end.
	\verb;mcbette; used a set of 40 candidate inference models, 
	consisting of all combinations of 
	4 site models (JC, HKY, TN, GTR), 
	2 clock models (strict, RLN) and 
	5 tree priors (Yule, BD, CBS, CCP, CEP).

	For each alignment, the inference model with the highest evidence
	is used in a Bayesian inference. From each Bayesian posterior,
	the parameter estimates regarding mutation rates (including clock rate)
	were obtained and compared to determine which realized mutation rate is lower.
	The Markov chain Monte Carlo was set up in such a way that the effective sample
	size for the likelihood of the inference model is above the recommended value
	of 200 (\cite{bouckaert2014beast}).

\section{Conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\iffalse
	We conclude that MHC-II binds to TMH peptides with a higher/lower/equal
	probability than expected by chance. 

	We conclude that the evolutionary conservation if the TMH parts of membrane
	proteins is higher/less/equal compare to its non-TMH counterparts.
\fi

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\iffalse
	We compared the mutation rates between the TMH and non-TMH part of
	multiple mycoplasma species. Where we expect no variation 
	in mutation rate for every TMH amino acid,
	\richel{
	  we can test this, but unsure if that would make sense
	}
	we know that non-TMH part will have regions of different evolutionary
	conservation: functional domains, especially in protein-protein
	interactions will be strongly conserved, due to an even more constrained
	set of peptides that enable a certain function.

	\richel{
	  Note that most bacteria are opportunistic pathogens.
	  Note that most bacteria are generalists.
	  Note that most bacteria have different cell membranes (and walls), that
	  may have different functional constraints than a human cell membrane
	}
