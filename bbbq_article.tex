\frans{Show off to Frans}
Cytolytic T cell responses are predicted to be biased towards membrane proteins. 
Because the peptide-binding grooves of most haplotypes 
of histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) are relatively hydrophobic, 
peptide fragments derived from transmembrane helices (TMHs) 
are predicted to be presented more often than expected,
based on their abundance in the proteome.
We show that the over-presentation of TMH-derived peptides is likely general, 
as it is predicted for diverse microbiota and viruses 
and for both MHC-I and MHC-II
However, the physiological reason of why membrane proteins might be 
over-presented is unclear
In this study, we show that TMHs are evolutionarily more conserved, 
as relatively less single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
are present in TMH-coding chromosomal regions 
compared to regions coding for extracellular and cytosolic protein regions. 
Thus, our findings suggest that T cells might respond 
more to membrane proteins, because these are evolutionary more conserved.
We speculate that TMHs therefor might be less prone to escape mutations 
that enable pathogens to evade T cell responses.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \paragraph{Immune response}

Our immune system fights diseases and infections from pathogens, 
such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. 
An important part of the acquired immune response, 
that develops specialized and more effective recognition of pathogens, 
are T cells which recognize peptides derived from 
exogenous antigens presented on Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHC). 

% \paragraph{Classification of HLA}

Any individual's immune system detects only a fraction of all possible
peptide fragments.
For humans, the MHC proteins are encoded by the
HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigens) genes.
There are three genes encoding for MHC-I, which are HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C,
for MHC-II there are three major genes, which are HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-DP.
Each MHC complex can only bind a subset of all possible peptides.
For example, HLA-A and HLA-B have no overlap in which
peptides they bind (\cite{lund2004definition})
[FB: is that really so?]
[RB: yes, according to the reference that is absent in the docx version to Lund et al., 2004, 'Definition of supertypes for {HLA} molecules using clustering of specificity matrices'] 
The HLA region of humans is highly polymorphic, with hundreds 
to thousands of different alleles, 
and each different HLA allele is called 
an MHC haplotype (\cite{marsh2010nomenclature}).

% \paragraph{HLAs increase detection range}

Because of these multiple and highly polymorphic MHC genes,
the number of pathogenic peptides that can be detected is increased,
as a wide variety of MHCs (6 MHC-I and 6-8 MHC-II molecules) 
are expressed per individual
each presenting their own subset of epitopes.
It is believed that this improves immunity at the population level, 
as mutations in a protein that disrupt a particular MHC presentation, 
so-called escape mutations, 
will not affect MHC presentation for all haplotypes (\cite{sommer2005importance}).

% \paragraph{Epitope prediction}

Many studies are aimed at determining which peptides are presented in MHC 
and will result in an immune response, 
as this will for instance aid the design of vaccines. 
These studies have led to the development 
of very reliable prediction algorithms 
that allows for in silico predictions 
of the binding affinities of peptides (\cite{larsen2010identification,schellens2008unanticipated,tang2011genome}).
 
% \paragraph{TMHs}

Using these prediction algorithms, 
we recently showed that peptides derived 
from transmembrane helices (TMHs) 
are predicted to be more frequently presented by MHC-I 
than expected based on their abundance (\cite{bianchi2017}). 
Moreover, we showed that some well-known immunodominant peptides stem from TMHs. 

This over-presentation is attributed to the fact 
that the peptide-binding groove of most MHC-I haplotypes 
is relatively hydrophobic, 
and therefore hydrophobic peptides have a higher affinity to bind
than hydrophilic ones. 

Transmembrane helices (TMHs) are hydrophobic 
as they need to span the hydrophobic lipid bilayer of cellular membranes.
They consist of an alpha helix on average 23 amino acids in length. 
TMHs are common structures in the proteins of humans and pathogens. 
Different TMH prediction tools estimate
that 15-39\% of the proteins in humans 
contain at least one TMH (\cite{ahram2006estimation}).
TMHs can also be predicted from a protein sequence 
with high accuracy by bioinformatics approaches (\cite{krogh2001predicting,bianchi2017,kall2004combined,arai2004conpred,jones2007improving,klammer2009metatm,wang2019efficient}).

However, the physiological reason why peptides derived from TMHs 
would be presented more often than peptides 
stemming from soluble protein regions is unknown. 
We hypothesized is that the presentation of 
TMH residues is evolutionary selected for, 
because TMHs are less prone to undergo escape mutation. 
One reason to expect such a reduced 
variability (and hence evolutionary conservation) in TMHs, 
is that these are restricted in their evolution 
by the functional requirement to span a lipid bilayer. 
Due to these requirements, 
the amino acids genuinely present in TMH 
are limited to the ones with hydrophobic side chains (\cite{jones1994model}).
[FB: Analyzing the occurrence of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
that were predicted to be inside ...][RJCB: Uh, you want to add another
paragraph here?]
Therefore, the TMHs of pathogens 
might have a lower chance to develop an escape mutations, 
as many mutations will result in a dysfunctional TMH 
and render the protein inactive.

From an elution study, we find that epitopes derived 
from TMHs are presented on naturally occurring MHC-II,
by finding the origin of these epitopes on a reference proteome,
of which we predicted all proteins' topologies.
From in silico predictions, we conclude that TMH-derived
epitopes are presented more often than expected by chance,
in a human, viral and bacterial proteome, for both MHC-I and II,
as these epitopes have a higher affinity with the presenter molecule.
From the generality of this pattern, we speculated that TMHs
are likely to be evolutionarily conserved. From an analysis using human
SNPs we found that these random point mutations are indeed less likely
to occur within TMHs. These findings encourage us to investigate the
overlooked importance of TMHs in the immune response and vaccine development.

\section{Methods}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Elution studies}\label{subsec:elution_studies}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To determine if epitopes derived from TMHs are presented 
we used two elution studies, which both have sequenced
epitopes found in naturally occurring human immune cells,
for MHC-I (\cite{schellens2015comprehensive}) 
and MHC-II (\cite{bergseng2015different}).
For each of the sequenced epitopes,
we found its possible location(s) in 
a human representative reference proteome,
with UniProt ID UP000005640\_9606.
For the epitopes that were found exactly once in the proteome,
we predicted the topology of the proteins in which the epitopes are found.
We used both TMHMM and PureseqTM to do these predictions. 
From this topology, we could determine if the epitope
overlapped with a transmembrane regions.

The full analysis can be found
at \url{https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/bbbq_article_issue_157}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Measuring TMH epitopes}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To determine how frequently epitopes overlapping with TMHs are presented,
we applied a similar analysis strategy as described in \cite{bianchi2017}.
To investigate the generality of this, we applied this analysis
for several haplotypes of both MHC-I and MHC-II, 
as well as for a human, viral and bacterial proteome.
To summarize, for each proteome, 
all possible 9-mers (for MHC-I) or 14-mers (MHC-II) are derived. 
For each of these peptides, we determined if it overlapped with a 
TMH and if it was a binder for each haplotype.

For MHC-I, 9-mers were used, as this is the length used in our earlier
study (\cite{bianchi2017}). For MHC-II, 14-mers were used, 
as these are the most frequently occurring
epitope length (\cite{bergseng2015different}).
We used a human (UniProt ID UP000005640\_9606), 
viral (SARS-CoV-2, UniProt ID UP000464024) 
and bacterial (Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb), UniProt ID UP000001584) 
reference proteome. The pathogens were chosen based 
on their impact on the human 
population \richel{ref}.
We used TMHMM  \richel{ref} to predict the topology 
of the proteins within the proteome.
To predict the affinity of an epitope to a certain MHC molecule,
we used \verb;EpitopePrediction; (\cite{bianchi2017}) for MHC-I 
and \verb;MHCnuggets; \richel{ref} for MHC-II.
The 13 MHC-I haplotypes used in this study are the same as 
used in our previous study (\cite{bianchi2017}).
The MHC-II haplotypes used additionally were selected 
to occur with a phenotypic frequency of at least 14\% in
the human population (\cite{greenbaum2011functional}),
resulting in 21 haplotypes.
\richel{This is Frans' text: 
Unlike MHC-I where only one variable chain determines the landscape of the epitope binding pocket allowing for the classification of 5 HLA-A and 8 HLA-B superhaplotypes with .... variation in peptide binding repertoire, the MHC-II peptide binding groove is determined by both the alpha and beta chain. For HLA DQ both the alpha and beta chain is highly polymorphic  ..... \frans{why is HLA-DP not predicted?}
We took the alleles that represent percentage of the occurrence int he overall human population according to ... et al. 
}


This study differs in some aspects from our previous work (\cite{bianchi2017}), 
The definition of a binder differs from \cite{bianchi2017}:
in the current study a peptide is called a binder if, within a certain haplotype, 
any of its 9-mer peptides have an IC50 value in the lowest 2\% of 
the epitopes within a 
\emph{proteome} (see tables \ref{tab:ic50_binders_mhc1} and \ref{tab:ic50_binders_mhc2}
for values), whereas the original study defined
a binder as having an IC50 in the lowest 2\% 
of the peptides within a \emph{protein}.
% See https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/bianchi_et_al_2017/blob/72e6755a31d400158368509fd80a41e984677ab1/predict-binders.R#L17
We believe our revised definition precludes bias of proteins 
that give rise to no or only very few MHC epitopes

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Evolutionary conservation of TMHs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \paragraph{Introduction}

To detect the evolutionary conservation of TMHs,
we collected human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
that resulted in a single amino the substitution,
and tallied if this substitution occurred within a TMH or not.
From that tally, we determined how likely the number of SNPs
found in TMHs is by chance.

% \paragraph{Data}

As a data source, multiple
NCBI (\url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/}) databases were used.
Pivotal was the 'dbSNP' (\cite{sherry2001dbsnp}) database,
which contains 650 million 
catalogued non-redundant humane variations (called RefSNPs,
\url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/docs/RefSNP_about/}).
Additionally, the aptly-named 'gene' (for gene names)
and 'protein' (for proteins sequences) database were used.

% \paragraph{Pipeline}

The first query was a call to the 'gene' database for the 
term 'membrane protein' (in all fields) for the organism \textbf{Homo sapiens}.
This resulted in 1077 gene IDs
[RJCB:
  This was December 2020.
  At 2021-03-01, one will get 1130 gene IDs.
  Also, one of the gene IDs that was valid back then,
  has been obsoleted.
].
The next query was a call to the 'gene' database 
to obtain the gene names from the gene IDs.
Per gene name, the 'dbSNP' NCBI database is queried for 
variations associated with the gene name. 

The number of variations
was limited to the first 250 variations per gene (see figure
\ref{fig:snps_per_gene_name_ncbi} for the number of SNPs
within the dbSNP database for these gene names),
resulting in 60,683 variations at the protein level.
Only variations that result in a SNP for
a single amino acid substitution were analysed, resulting in 38,882 SNPs.

% \paragraph{Selection of SNPs}
%
SNPs were picked based on ID number, which is linked to their discovery date. To verify that ID number is unrelated to SNP positions the relative positons of the analyzed SNPS in a protein was determined and showed no positional bias, shown in figure \ref{fig:snp_rel_pos}.

Per SNP, the 'protein' NCBI database was queried for the
protein sequence.
Of each protein sequence, the protein topology was determined 
using PureseqTM.
Using the protein topology SNPs were scored to be in or outside trans membrane domains.

\section{Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Elution studies}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% tab:elution
\input{bbbq_article_issue_157/results.tex}

To confirm that peptides stemming from TMHs were presented in MHC-I and MHC-II,
peptide elution studies were reanalyzed.
Table \ref{tab:elution} shows the percentage of epitopes derived 
from a TMH
found in MHC-I and MHC-II elution 
studies (\cite{schellens2015comprehensive} and \cite{bergseng2015different} respectively),
for the two topology prediction tools TMHMM and 
PureseqTM (\cite{krogh2001predicting} and \cite{wang2019efficient} respectively). 
Regardless of the prediction, 
at least 100 epitopes were predicted to be derived from a TMH. 
From these findings, it is robustly predicted that
epitopes derived from TMHs are presented by B cells.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{MHC-I}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We recently showed that peptides derived from TMHs of human proteins 
were predicted to be over-presented on HLA-A and HLA-B. 
Here, we wondered if this finding would be general 
and if peptides stemming from predicted TMHs of microbial pathogens 
would also be over-presented on HLA-A and HLA-B.We therefor analysed all superhaplotypes of the HLA-A and HLA-B class see Figure \ref{fig:1} and found that similar as for the human proteome the percentages of MHC-I epitopes predicted to be overlapping with TMHs for our human, viral and bacterial proteome was higher as expected by TMH abundance.
See the supplementary materials (table \ref{tab:tmh_binders_mhc1}) 
The extent of the over-presentation between the various different HLA supertypes is similar for the probed proteomes, which confirms that the hydrophopbicity of the MHC binding cleft is determinant.

  }
  \label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{MHC-II}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We next wondered if this over-representation would also generalize to MHC-II. 
Figure \ref{fig:2} shows the percentages of MHC-II epitopes overlapping 
with TMHs for our human, viral and bacterial proteome.
See the supplementary materials (table \ref{tab:tmh_binders_mhc2}) 
for the TMH and epitope counts.
We show that MHC-II has the same pattern of over-presentation
as MHC-I, yet this over-presentation is more pronounced. 
\frans{
  we should explain this does it like shown for mhc-I also 
  linearly correlates with the hydrophopbicity 
  of the MHC-II binding cleft?
}
Also for MHC-II, we observe that the extent to which TMH-derived
epitopes are presented is similar between the haplotypes, for
a human, bacterial and viral proteome.

    Note that for smaller proteomes a percentage of zero is likelier.

    transmembrane proteins.
  }
  \label{fig:f_snps_found_and_expected}
\end{figure}

In general the occurrence and expression levels of membrane proteins are low, therefor we addressed the question whether there is an evolutionary advantage for presenting TMHs. To this end we looked for conservation the conservation in TMH vs soluble regions by comparing the occurrences of SNPs in the genome coding for TMHs versus soluble protein regions within membrane proteins.
We obtained >1000 gene names associated with the phrase 'membrane protein',
which are genes for both membrane-associated proteins (MAPs, no TMH) and 
transmembrane proteins (TMPs, at least one TMH).
These genes are linked to 4,780 protein isoforms, 
of which 2,553 are predicted to be TMPs (hence 
2,237 proteins are predicted to be MAPs).
We obtained 37,630 SNPs that resulted in an
amino acids substitution, of which 21,024 were located 
in predicted TMPs.
See tables \ref{tab:ncbi_counts_1} and \ref{tab:ncbi_counts_2} 
for an overview of all amounts.

Per protein, we calculated two percentages: 
(1) the percentage of the protein coding for TMHs, 
and (2) the percentage of SNPs occurring in TMHs.
Each percentage pair was plotted in figure \ref{fig:f_snps_found_and_expected}.
We performed a linear regression analyses on the data twice,
one with and one without MAPs,
and added a 95\% confidence interval for both of these regressions.
Would the confidence interval of the regression line 
overlap with the line of equality,
this would be expected if SNPs occur just as likely within TMHs 
and soluble protein domains.
This analysis gives the first hint that SNPs 
occur more often in soluble domains than in TMHs.\frans{waar vind ik dan nu het verschil tussen met en zonder MAPs je zou hopen dat er geen verschil is toch omdat het aandeel TMH in de analyse met MAPS ook naar beneden gaat}
To statistically test whether SNPs occur 
just as likely in soluble domains as
in TMHs, we first calculated the number of SNPs that are expected to be
found in TMHs of TMPs by chance, $E(n_{SNP\_TMH})$,
equals the number of SNPs in TMHs, $n_{SNP} = 21,738$, 
multiplied by the fraction of the TMPs that are TMH, $f_{TMH} = 18.66\%$,
$E(n_{SNP\_TMH}) = n_{SNP} \cdot f_{TMH} \approx 4056$.

The effect size is that, 
when randomly selecting SNPs, 
per 100 SNPs found in soluble protein domains, 
one finds 91 SNPs in TMHs,
as depicted in figure \ref{fig:conservation}.

The actual number of SNPs found in TMHs
was $n_{SNP\_TMH} = 3,903$, which is lower than the expectation
of $E(n_{SNP\_TMH}) \approx 4056$.
To test whether this difference is significant,
we used a binomial Poisson distribution, where the number of trails,
$n$ equals the number of SNPs, which is 21,738. The probability of success
for TMP $i$, $p\_i$, is the percentage of each TMP that is TMH.
We calculated the probability of having 3,903 or less successes.
We used the type I error cut-off value of $\alpha = 2.5\%$.
The chance to find, within TMHs, this amount or less SNPs 
equals [RJCB: recalculate]
$1.6201 \cdot 10^{-9}$.

Using a alpha value of $0.05$, as is common practice for an uninformed
expectation, we conclude that there are significantly less SNPs
in TMHs as expected by chance.

[RJCB: How many SNPs in TMHs?]
See figure \ref{fig:f_tmh_ncbi} to see which percentages
are TMH of the transmembrane proteins.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ncbi_peregrine_results/fig_f_snps_found_and_expected_per_spanner.png}

    Percentage of SNPs found in TMHs per spanner.

    if TMHs and soluble protein regions are equally conserved.
  }
  \label{fig:f_snps_found_and_expected_per_spanner}
\end{figure}
)

We decided to split this analysis based on the number of TMHs
a protein has 
[GVDB: Why? Provide brief rationale again. 
Thus TMH-TMH interactions or something]. 
We hypothesize that single-spanners (i.e. proteins
with one TMH predicted) are less conserved, when compared to multi-spanners,
as single spanners just need to span a membrane, while multi-spanners
might have interactions between their TMHs, 
for example to accommodate active sites, and 
thus might have additional structural constraints.
As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:f_snps_found_and_expected_per_spanner}, 
both single- and multi-spanners are evolutionarily conserved.

We conclude that,
when randomly selecting SNPs, 
for 100 SNPs found in soluble regions of multi-spanners,
one finds 89.6 SNPs in TMHs, as shown by \frans{it says 91,1 in fig 4}
figure \ref{fig:conservation_per_spanner}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

[GVDB: 
  Discussion section needs some work, 
  as here interpretation of the results needs to be given. 
  What is the consequence of the findings? Why is it important. 
]

% \paragraph{General}

Our understanding of the immune system and epitope prediction is 
important to fight disease. By this paper, we suggest that epitopes
derived from TMHs are needlessly overlooked and may inspire to investigate
new potential targets for combating pathogens.
\frans{ik zie hier verder geen argumentatie voor deze statement}
\subsection{Elution studies}

% \paragraph{TMH presentation in vivo}

From elution studies and in silico predictions, 
we suggest that TMH-derived epitopes are presented and cross-presented in vivo. How integral membrane proteins are presented and cross-presented on MHC complexes is however unclear. Most prominently because the fundamental principles of trans locating integral membrane proteins from there hydrophobic environment into the vacuole lumen and subsequent processing prior to loading on MHC complexes is unresolved. 

% \paragraph{False positives}

An additional unknown is, although our findings are robust,
whether this is a false positive,
due to additive methodological artifacts.
An obvious artifact is that the elution studies used 
will contain some unavoidable sequencing errors.
Additionally, we assume that the epitopes naturally presented
are derived from a cleanly translated proteome.
Two known biological phenomena that violate this assumption
are defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) (\cite{yewdell1996defective}) 
and peptide fusion (\cite{delong2016pathogenic}),
two processes that both result in peptide fragments
that did not originate from genome directly.
Also, the TMH prediction software is imperfect.
This imperfection, however, appears to be of limited importance,
as two different topology prediction software algorithms gave similar results.
Although those a couple of percent of epitopes that 
can be mapped directly to the proteome,
there is methodological bias caused by mass spectronomy,
as hydrophobic fragments are detected less 
by mass spectronomy. This means that the number of TMH-derived epitopes
is underestimated.
in vivo work in the lab will be needed to resolve this finding.

\subsection{Presentation of epitopes derived from TMHs}

% \paragraph{MHC-II is expected to present TMHs}
\frans{we moeten iets schrijven over de verschillende haplotypen wat is the occurence van de haplotypen met andere worden hoe relevnet zijn de haplotypen die veel TMH presenteren?}

The over representation of TMH on MHC-II haplotypes such as HLADQA!*0101/DQB*0501 is more pronounced as for MHC-I with a third of the predicted binders from the human and MtB proteome stem from TMH  human reference proteome and MtB reference proteome to be presented on MHC-II. \frans{ik zoek nog naar associaties} 

This study predict that TMH-derived epitopes are over-presented
in MHC-II as well. 
The intracellular pathway of MHC-II differs from that of MHC-I,
as it acquires epitopes from the exterior of the cell by phagocytosis.
How TMHs derived from exterior TMPs are lysed and loaded onto MHC-II 
is unknown. in vivo work is needed to elucidate this novel pathway.

% \paragraph{Immunogenicity}

In this study, we find that TMH-derived epitopes are over-presented.
The presentation of an epitope, however, 
is only a first step of an adaptive immune response.
We assume that the presentation of epitopes is
correlated with evoking a full immune response.
TMH-derived epitopes, however, are more hydrophobic than the average
epitope. If this evokes a stronger or weaker immune response is unknown,
and in vivo work is needed to resolve this.

\subsection{Evolutionary conservation of TMHs}

% \paragraph{Low number of SNPs}

The NCBI dbSNP database contains millions of SNPs.
As the NCBI API constrains its users to three calls per second
to assure fair use, we had to limit the extent of our analysis.
We assume we have taken a representative sample, but only
an analysis using the full NCBI database can confirm this.

% \paragraph{Selection undetectable in whole proteome}
 
In general, on would hope that evolutionary selection results in
an immune system that as most attentive for loci that are
essential for a virus, as these will be most conserved.
In SARS-CoV-2, for example, there is preliminary evidence that the strongest
selection pressure is upon residues that changes its 
virulence (\cite{velazquez2020positive}).
These loci, however, only account for a small part of a pathogen's proteome.
Additionally, these essential parts differ widely between pathogens.
Because of this scarcity and variance in targets, 
one can imagine that the human immune system 
is not tailored to detect these sites, 
as hinted upon by an extensive study on influenza (\cite{han2019individual}),
where it was found that the selection pressure
exerted by the immune system was a non pro founding factor.
 
% \paragraph{Selection may be detectable in TMHs}

TMHs, on the other hand, also have their functional constraints, 
and make up ... of a human, bacterial or viral proteome.
One can safely assume a proteome contains many TMHs,
therefore it may be beneficial for the host
if its immune system would be more attentive towards TMHs.
And maybe this has already happened: MHC-I already detects hydrophobic
peptides. This feature, however, may also be caused by selection
to detect hydrophobic regions in the soluble proteins of pathogens.
It is unknown, when focusing on TMHs only, if a signal of selection
can be detected.\frans{ik snap deze redenatie niet?}
We speculate that the human immune system is more attentive 
towards TMHs, as it is a general structure, that is evolutionarily conserved.

We aimed our evolutionary experiment at TMHs, because these can
be predicted well from a protein structure,
are common structures and are present in all pathogens. \frans{ dit doen we toch omdat we vinden dat er een preferred binding affinity is voor hydrophobe peptides?}
We could have done the same experiment on beta-sheets,
as also these can be predicted well (\cite{petersen2010netturnp}),
are common structures and are present in all pathogens.
We speculate that the human immune system may also be more attentive 
towards beta sheets for this reason.

[GVDB: 
  Also compare your findings with previous efforts 
  to look at conservation of TMHs

From this study, two important conclusions can be drawn. 
First, the MHC over-presentation of TMHs is likely a general feature 
and predicted to occur for most haplotypes of both MHC-I and -II 
and for humans as well as bacterial and viral pathogens. 
Second, TMHs are more evolutionary conserved that soluble protein motifs, 
at least in the human proteome. 

% \paragraph{Over-presentation in vivo in MHC-I is robust}

We confirm that 1.4\% of epitopes that are naturally presented on MHC-I 
can be mapped to stem from a TMH. Additionally, this 
prediction is robust, as it holds for two TMH prediction tools, 
as shown by table \ref{tab:elution}).

% \paragraph{Over-presentation in vivo in MHC-II is robust}

We predict that also MHC-II presents epitopes derived from TMHs
in vivo, as we find that 3.9-4.0\% of sequenced epitopes
can be uniquely traced onto a human reference 
proteome (also shown in table \ref{tab:elution}).

% \paragraph{Over-presentation in silico}

Not only do we predict that MHC-I and MHC-II TMH-derived epitopes 
are presented in vivo, we conclude that these are additionally
presented more often than expected by chance 
alone (figures \ref{fig:1} and \ref{fig:2}).
This in silico finding is a general pattern 
that persists in both MHC-I and MHC-II, 
for humans, bacteria and viruses. 

% \paragraph{Evolutionary conservation}

We conclude that mutations are more likely to occur
in soluble regions of proteins, than in TMHs.
When selecting SNPs at random, per 1000 SNPs found in a soluble domain, 
one finds on average 918 SNPs in TMHs.
This effect is more pronounced in multi spanners likely as these TMHs more often serve additional functions, besides spanning the lipid bilayer.

\subsection{Differences with Bianchi et al., 2017}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A part of this study does the same analysis as Bianchi et al., 2017.
Here we describe the deviations, which are about the use of different
software and the use of a different definition of what a binder is.

% \paragraph{IC50 prediction software}

The earlier study uses \verb;epitope-prediction; a hand-crafted method, 
that has been trained on MHC-I haplotypes only,
which is used here again. For MHC-II IC50 predictions, the
'mhcnuggetsr' R package is used.

% \paragraph{Definition of what a binder is}

The earlier study defines a peptide a binder (for a haplotype), 
if \emph{within the peptide} in which it is found, 
is within the peptides with the 2\% lowest IC50 values.
This can be seen at \url{https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/bianchi_et_al_2017/blob/master/predict-binders.R},
where the binders are written to file.

In this study, a peptide is defined a binder (for a haplotype), 
if within a \emph{proteome} in which it is found, 
is within the peptides with the 2\% lowest IC50 values,
where our previous study used the lowest 2\% IC50 values
within each \emph{protein}.
Subsection \ref{subsec:ic50s_per_haplotype} shows the IC50 values
for a binder per haplotype.

% \paragraph{Selenoproteins}

Our previous study used the TMHMM web server
to predict TMHs.
The desktop version of TMHMM, however, gives an
error message on the 25 selenoproteins found in the human
reference proteome.
For the sake of reproducible research, we use the desktop version (as
we can call it from scripts) and, due to this, we removed the
selenoproteins from this analysis.

    Overview of all software used in this research.

  \label{table:software_used}
\end{table}

For this research, the scientific literature was explored 
to identify the most recent free and open source (FOSS) prediction software.
This was done by searching for papers that (1) reference older
prediction software, and (2) present a novel method to make predictions.
As a starting point, a review paper was used.
For all software needed, we found no studies that compared contemporary tools 
in their prediction quality.

% \paragraph{TMH prediction}

There are multiple computational tools developed to predict which
parts of a protein forms a TMH.
In 2001, multiple of such prediction tools have been compared (\cite{moller2001evaluation}),
of which TMHMM (\cite{krogh2001predicting}) turned out to be the best, 
as is used in the previous study (\cite{bianchi2017}).
However, TMHMM has a restrictive software license and is nearly two
decades old.
Therefore, PureseqTM (\cite{wang2019efficient}),
was also used in this study, which has been more recently developed
and has a free software license.

% \paragraph{MHC-I epitope prediction}

For MHC-I, there are multiple computational tools developed 
to predict epitopes. 
According to \cite{lundegaard2011prediction}, at that time,
NetMHCcons (\cite{karosiene2012netmhccons}) gave the best predictions.
We used the same tool as used in our earlier study, \verb;epitope-prediction; (\cite{bianchi2017}),

% \paragraph{MHC-II epitope prediction}

Also for MHC-II, there are multiple computational tools developed 
to predict epitopes,
such as using a trained neural network (\cite{nielsen2003reliable})
or a Gibbs sampling approach (\cite{nielsen2004improved}).
According to \cite{lundegaard2011prediction}, in 2011,
from a set of multiple tools, 
NetMHCIIpan (\cite{nielsen2008quantitative,karosiene2013netmhciipan})
gave rise to the most accurate predictions.
The most recent and promising FOSS tool available now appears
to be MHCnuggets (\cite{shao2020high}), which can do both MHC-I 
and MHC-II prediction, which we used for MHC-II predictions.

% \paragraph{NCBI data retrieval software}

To retrieve the data from the NCBI databases the
\verb;rentrez; R package (\cite{rentrez}) was used
that calls the NCBI website's API. To provide for a 
stable user experience for all users, 
this API limits the user to 3 calls per second.
Additionally, the API splits the result of a bigger
query into multiple pages, each of which needs one API call.
We wrote the \verb;sprentrez; package (\cite{sprentrez}) to provide for 
bigger queries of multiple (and delayed) API calls.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Prediction software written}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The R programming language is used for the complete 
experiment, including the analysis.
The complete experiment is bundled in the 'bbbq' R package,
which is dependent on 'tmhmm', 'pureseqtmr', 
'epitope-prediction' and 'mhcnuggetsr'
as described below.

% \paragraph{tmhmm}

The R package 'tmhmm' was developed to do the similar topology
predictions as our earlier study (that used 'TMHMM'), yet in an automated way.
'TMHMM' has a restrictive software license (\cite{krogh2001predicting}) and allows a user
to download a pre-compiled executable after confirmation he/she
is in academia. The R package respects this restriction
and allows the user to install and use TMHMM from within R,
as done in this study.
'tmhmm' has been submitted to and is accepted by CRAN. \frans{wat is CRAN}

% \paragraph{pureseqtmr}

To be able to call, from R, the TMH prediction 
software 'PureseqTM' (\cite{wang2019efficient}),
which is written in C, the package 'pureseqtmr' has been developed. 
'pureseqtmr' allows to install 'PureseqTM' and use most of its features.
Excluded are the features that are used by the 'PureseqTM' 
developers to verify the correctness of their work.
'pureseqtmr' has been submitted to and is accepted by CRAN.

% \paragraph{mhcnuggetsr}

MHCnuggets is a free and open-source Python package to predict 
epitope affinity for many MHC-I and MHC-II variants (\cite{shao2020high}).
The R package 'mhcnuggetsr' allows one to install and use MHCnuggets
from within R.
Also 'mhcnuggetsr' has been submitted to and is accepted by CRAN.

% \paragraph{bbbq}

To reproduce the full experiment presented in this paper,
the functions needed are bundled in the 'bbbq' R package.
This package is too specific to be submitted to CRAN.

\subsection{Percentage of spots and spots that overlap with a TMH}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Table \ref{tab:f_tmh} shows an overview of the findings,
where a target specifies the source of the proteome,
where \verb;covid; denotes SARS-CoV-2 and \verb;covid; denotes
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. \verb;mhc_class; denotes the MHC
class, \verb;n_spots; the number of possible 9-mers (for MHC-I) 
or 14-mers (for MHC-II) possible. \verb;n_spots_tmh; the
number of epitopes that overlapped with a TMH that were binders. 
\verb;f_tmh; the percentage of peptides that had at least 1 residue
overlapping with a TMH.

% Label: tab:f_tmh

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Minor methods}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These are details that are removed from the 'Methods' section.

PureseqTM does not predict the topology
of proteins that have less than three amino acids. 
The TRDD1 ('T cell receptor delta diversity 1') protein,
however, is two peptides long. 
The R package \verb;pureseqtmr;, however, 
predicts that mono- and di-peptides are cytosolic.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Minor discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These are details that are removed from the 'Discussion' section.

% \paragraph{Bacteria have a different cell membrane}

In this experiment we predicted epitopes that overlap with 
TMHs from a human, bacterial and viral proteome,
would these proteins be expressed in a human host.
Bacteria, however have different cell membranes and cell walls, 
hence different structural requirements for a TMH.
Both topology prediction tools were trained to recognize
human TMHs, thus we cannot be sure that
the transmembrane regions predicted in bacterial proteins
are actually part of a TMH.
For the purpose of this study, we assume the 
error in topology predictions to be unbiased way towards topology.
In other words: that a bacterial TMH is incorrectly
predicted to be absent just as often as it is incorrectly
predicted to be present elsewhere.

% \paragraph{False positives in SNPs}

Regarding the evolutionary conservation of TMHs using SNPs,
again, it is estimated that approximately ten percent
of SNPs is a false positive that result from the methods to determine
a SNP. One example is that sequence variations are incorrectly
detected due to highly similar duplicated sequences \cite{musumeci2010single}.
We assume that these duplications occur as often in TMHs as in
regions around these, hence we expect this not to affect our results.

% \paragraph{synonymous mutations}
%
In our evolutionary experiment, 
we removed variations that were synonymous mutations (i.e.
resulted in the same amino acid, from a different genetic code) 
from our analysis.
There is evidence, however, that these synonymous mutations
do have an effect and may even be evolutionary selected 
for (\cite{hunt2009silent}).
As the possible effect of synonymous mutations is ignored by our
topology prediction software, we do so as well.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{IC50s per haplotype}
\label{subsec:ic50s_per_haplotype}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Per target proteome (i.e. human, SARS-CoV-2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis),
we collected all 9-mers (for MHC-I) and 14-mers (for MHC-II),
after removing the selenoproteins and proteins that are shorter
than the epitope length.
From these epitopes, per MHC haplotype,
we predicted the IC50 (in nM) using \verb;epitope-prediction; (for MHC-I)
and MHCnuggets (for MHC-II). 
Here, we show the IC50 value per haplotype that
is used to determine if a peptide binds to the haplotype's MHC
for MHC-I (see table \ref{tab:ic50_binders_mhc1}) and 
MHC-II (see table \ref{tab:ic50_binders_mhc2}).
