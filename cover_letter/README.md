## Letter that resulted from the requirements

Dear Editor,

We hereby would like to submit our paper 
entitled 'Transmembrane helices are an overlooked and evolutionarily conserved
source of major histocompatibility complex class I and II epitopes.' 
for publication in PLoS Biology.

Antigen presentation in major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) is essential 
for the activation of T cells, 
and much research is aimed at dissecting 
the underlying cellular mechanisms and predicting immunodominant epitopes, 
for instance for designing better vaccines [1,2]
However, a neglected fact is that most MHC haplotypes 
in the human population present hydrophobic peptides, 
which, as we showed previously for MHC class I presentation 
to cytolytic T cells [3], 
results in an over-presentation of epitopes 
derived from transmembrane helices (TMH) 
that are embedded in the hydrophobic lipid environment of cellular membranes. 

In this study, we addressed the two major questions raised by this finding: 
(i) Is the over-presentation of TMH-derived epitopes a general feature 
also observable for MHC class II presentation to T helper cells? (ii) 
What is the physiological reason why TMH-derived peptides are over-presented?

Our bioinformatics predictions and analysis of peptide elution studies 
demonstrate that TMH-derived epitopes are presented more often 
than expected by chance, for almost all MHC-I and MHC-II haplotypes 
in the human population and regardless of the origin of the 
protein (i.e., human, bacterial or viral).

Moreover, analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human 
population revealed that transmembrane helices are evolutionary more 
conserved than solvent-exposed protein domains, 
suggesting that the over-presentation of TMH-derived epitopes 
might be evolutionary advantageous as they are less prone 
to so-called escape mutations that prevent antigen presentation.

Thus, we demonstrate that transmembrane helices are a major, 
overlooked and evolutionary conserved source of MHC epitopes. 

We look forward to your evaluation.


Best wishes and kind regards,

## Adaptation of earlier cover letter

Dear Editor,

We hereby would like to submit our paper 
entitled 'Transmembrane helices are an overlooked and evolutionarily conserved
source of major histocompatibility complex class II epitopes.' 
for publication in PLoS Biology.

In this manuscript, 
we reason that MHC class II epitopes 
derived from transmembrane helices of membrane proteins are presented more
often than can be explained by chance. 
Due to the strict compositional requirements of transmembrane helices, 
this can well constitute a novel mechanism 
of how escape mutations by pathogens are prevented. 
Moreover, it raises the question how membrane proteins are (cross-)presented, 
because currently described mechanisms cannot explain 
their processing for MHC class II presentation. 
Finally, we hypothesize how MHC class II presentation of membrane-buried epitopes 
can contribute to the disease correlations described for many HLA haplotypes. 

We look forward to your evaluation.
