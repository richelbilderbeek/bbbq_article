# Cover letter

## Requirements

 * [Requirements](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/submission-guidelines#loc-cover-letter)

 * [x] What is the scientific question you are addressing?

Is it a general and evolutionarily conserved pattern 
that TMH-derived epitopes are presented more
often than expected by chance by the human immune system?

 * [x] What is the key finding that answers this question?

We found for the large majority of MHC-I and MHC-II haplotypes, in
a human, bacterial and viral proteome, that TMH-derived epitopes
are presented more often than expected by chance.

 * [x] What is the nature of the evidence you provide in support of your conclusion?

Our evidence is obtained from multiple in silico analyses,
based on protein sequences from two elution studies,
three reference proteomes and SNPs from the NCBI database.

 * [] What are the three most recently published articles 
      that are relevant to this question?

   * [1] Frans Bianchi, Johannes Textor, and Geert van den Bogaart. 
     "Transmembrane Helices are an overlooked source of Major 
     Histocompatibility Complex Class I epitopes." 
     Frontiers in immunology 8 (2017): 1118.

RICHEL: Geert, bij deze kan ik wat hulp gebruiken :-)

 * [x] What significance do your results have for the field?

We reason that epitopes derived from transmembrane helices are
an overlooked source of epitopes.

 * [x] What significance do your results have for the broader community (of biologists and/or the public)?

We suggest that the human immune system obtains its antigens not only
from cytosolic proteines, but from membrane proteins as well.

 * [x] What other novel findings do you present?

We find that the over-presentation of epitopes derived from
transmembrane helices is evolutionarily conserved.

 * [x] Is there additional information that we should take into account?

This study expands our previous research [1].

## Letter that resulted from the requirements

Dear Editor,

We hereby would like to submit our paper 
entitled 'Transmembrane helices are an overlooked and evolutionarily conserved
source of major histocompatibility complex class II epitopes.' 
for publication in PLoS Biology.

In this manuscript, we investigate
if it is a general and evolutionarily conserved pattern 
that TMH-derived epitopes are presented more
often than expected by chance by the human immune system.

noemen die relevant zijn. Bij deze kan ik wat hulp gebruiken :-)

We reason that epitopes derived from transmembrane helices are
an overlooked source of epitopes and 
we suggest that the human immune system obtains its antigens not only
from cytosolic proteines, but from membrane proteins as well.
Finally, we find that the over-presentation of epitopes derived from
transmembrane helices is evolutionarily conserved.

We look forward to your evaluation.

## Adaptation of earlier cover letter

Dear Editor,

We hereby would like to submit our paper 
entitled 'Transmembrane helices are an overlooked and evolutionarily conserved
source of major histocompatibility complex class II epitopes.' 
for publication in PLoS Biology.

In this manuscript, 
we reason that MHC class II epitopes 
derived from transmembrane helices of membrane proteins are presented more
often than can be explained by chance. 
Due to the strict compositional requirements of transmembrane helices, 
this can well constitute a novel mechanism 
of how escape mutations by pathogens are prevented. 
Moreover, it raises the question how membrane proteins are (cross-)presented, 
because currently described mechanisms cannot explain 
their processing for MHC class II presentation. 
Finally, we hypothesize how MHC class II presentation of membrane-buried epitopes 
can contribute to the disease correlations described for many HLA haplotypes. 

We look forward to your evaluation.
